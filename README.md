# customer_banking

This Python script consists of two main functions, create_savings_account and create_cd_account, imported from separate files. Upon running, it prompts the user to input details for creating a savings account and a certificate of deposit (CD) account, including initial balance, interest rate, and the length of time (in months) for which the account will be held.

After receiving input, it calculates the interest earned and updates the account balances accordingly, utilizing the imported functions. It then prints out the updated balances and the interest earned for both types of accounts.
